#Overview: In this demo I would like to showcase how you can copy multiple files from the storage based on the metadata control table status.
#Technology: Azure Data Lake gen2, Sql Server, Data Factory
#Output: Ready to use parameterized pipeline to dynamically copy the files from a ADLS folder as soon as the Control Table's status is changed.
